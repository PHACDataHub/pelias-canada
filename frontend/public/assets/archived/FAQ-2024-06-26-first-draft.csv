General Information,What is geocoding?,"Generally speaking, geocoding is ability to resolve a textual, civic street address into its corresponding point on the Earth (i.e. in latitude and longitude)."
General Information,Are there different types of geocoding?,"Yes. The simplest one is forward single-address look-up. This is okay for one-off searches. However, most people have documents or files that have 100s or even tens of thousands of civic addresses. To do this manually would be error prone, timely, and inefficient. This is where bulk forward geocoding comes in handy. Generally this bulk geocoding is done by power GIS practitioners with niche and expensive desktop software and custom data. However, with a REST endpoint, front-end services can be created to programmatically iterate or go through rows and rows of files, returning their corresponding latitudes and longitudes at a minimum.  Reverse geocoding is exactly what is sounds like: instead of having the address, it take latitude/longitude pairs and returns a candidate list of the closest corresponding civic addresses "
Technical Details,How can I programmatically develop using the Pelias REST endpoints?," One is free to use any front-end or back-end programming language. Commonly used is R, Python, and Javascript libraries. See the previous snippets for examples of how to incorporate the REST APIs."
Costs and Licensing,Esri and Google have geocoding services. Why should I use your Pelias service?,"Cost: 0.004 to 0.006$ per look up. This can add up quickly with the average number of rows that a file contains in a given project. For example, 100,000 address can cost between $400-$600 per lookup session. This does not account for running the address a second, or third time for QC/QA or with addresses that didn't resolve - requiring manual override.  "
General Information,Is this the final version of the Pelias service?,No. It is in constant improvement. We seek your feed back and encourage engagement with our Dev team to evaluate and incorporate your suggestions.
Features and Capabilities,Didn't other Federal departments/Agencies have geocoding available?,"Yes, but for a short period of time. As of late 2023, StatCan's geocoding service has been taken off line. NRcan has a geocoding service but its spatial accuracy is not 'roof-top' grade and is interpolated (estimated) by street segment at best. Unfortunately, this does not meet the modern needs/expectations of enterprise geocoding services."
General Information,What is the source of the address data.,"Right now, there are two data sources. The default source for bulk forward geocoding is the OpenStreetMap data (epoch ___); the second one is StatCan's Address Registry data which is publicly available for verification. "
Technical Details,"The latitude and longitude don't look like degrees-minute-seconds, what is this format?",The format given back is decimal degrees in latitude and longitude. Furthermore the coordinate system used is WGS1984. This knowledge will have an impact and needs to be known when using for post-analysis uses.
Features and Capabilities,What other features do you have on the development horizon?,"We are looking at the following features to incorporate into the back-end and the front-end: i. reverse geocoding ii. QSTRM for rural, western Canadian address deterction iii. Ability to change datums/coordinates as an output iv. Export of shapefiles/geojson"
Technical Details,Which GIS software and solutions are available to me after I get my geocoded points?,There are a few solutions depending on your level of complexity and commitment. i. HC/PHAC is developing a (H)ELK stack where you can request a username/password for Kibana Elastic Map account. You can do some thematic mapping and overlay your points. Ii. Software download centre: QGIS is available for install on your local computer.iii. Esri ArcPro 3.x: DTB Geomatics has specialized VM environments with Esri software and the ability to scale on demand for heavier spatial analysis processes.
