General Information,"What is geocoding?","Geocoding is the process of converting a physical address (like “123 Main Street”) into geographic coordinates—typically latitude and longitude—that represent that location on a map. This is useful for mapping, navigation, and location-based services."
General Information,"Are there different types of geocoding?","Yes, geocoding generally falls into two main categories: forward and reverse geocoding. Forward geocoding takes a street address and converts it into geographic coordinates—latitude and longitude. This can be done as a simple one-time lookup or as a bulk process when working with large files containing hundreds or even thousands of addresses. Manually converting these addresses would be time-consuming and error-prone, which is why bulk geocoding is preferred for efficiency and accuracy. Traditionally, this has required specialized Geographic Information System (GIS) software—often expensive and complex to use. Our service offers a more accessible and cost-effective alternative through a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API), which allows developers to automate geocoding by programmatically processing large datasets. Reverse geocoding, on the other hand, works in the opposite direction by taking geographic coordinates and returning the closest matching address, making it useful for mapping, tracking, and location-based applications."
Technical Details,"How can I programmatically develop using the Pelias REST endpoints?","You can interact with the Pelias Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) using any front-end or back-end programming language. Common choices include Python, R, and JavaScript, all of which offer libraries or tools to make requests to the API and handle responses. Whether you're developing a web app, automating data processing, or building geospatial tools, Pelias is designed to be flexible and accessible. For reference, visit the developer R or Python pages on the Pelias website to see code snippets and examples of how to incorporate the REST API into your project."
Costs and Licensing,"Esri and Google have geocoding services. Why should I use your Pelias service?","While geocoding platforms like Esri and Google are well-established and powerful, their cost can escalate quickly. At $0.004 to $0.006 per lookup, processing a typical file containing 100,000 addresses could cost between $400 and $600 in a single session. These costs increase further when reprocessing is needed for quality control (QC), quality assurance (QA), or unresolved addresses that require manual intervention. In contrast, our Pelias-based solution offers a significantly more cost-effective alternative, particularly for bulk geocoding. It's also easy to use—our front-end removes the need for expensive, specialized Geographic Information System (GIS) software or Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), as long as addresses contain basic components like street number, street name, street type, city or town, and province. The system can also handle minor formatting inconsistencies, making it accessible to a broader user base. Perhaps most importantly, our Health Canada - Digital Transformation Branch Geocoder (HC-DTB) ensures that all lookups are performed within a secure, internal environment. Unlike other services that transmit data to external servers, our approach minimizes privacy risks and supports compliance with internal data protection standards."
General Information,"Is this the final version of the Pelias service?","No, the Pelias service is continuously evolving. We are actively working to improve its features, performance, and usability based on user needs. Feedback is an essential part of this process, and we welcome input from users to help guide future development. We encourage you to share your experiences and suggestions with our development team so we can evaluate and incorporate them into future updates."
Features and Capabilities,"Don't other Federal departments/Agencies have geocoding available?","Yes, some federal departments and agencies have offered geocoding services, but often only for limited periods. For example, as of late 2023, Statistics Canada (StatsCan) has taken its geocoding service offline. Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) still provides a geocoding service; however, its spatial accuracy is not “roof-top” grade and instead relies on interpolation along street segments, which means locations are estimated rather than pinpointed precisely. This level of accuracy falls short of the modern standards and expectations required for enterprise-grade geocoding services."
General Information,"What is the source of the address data?","Currently, our service uses two main data sources. The default source for bulk forward geocoding is OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, updated as of [epoch ___ ]. Additionally, we use Statistics Canada's Address Registry data, which is publicly available and serves as a reliable reference for address verification."
Technical Details,"The latitude and longitude don't look like degrees-minute-seconds, what is this format?","The coordinates returned by our service are expressed in decimal degrees format for both latitude and longitude. This is a common and widely used format in digital mapping and geospatial applications because it simplifies calculations and data processing. Additionally, the coordinate system used is the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84), which is the global standard for GPS and most mapping platforms. Knowing this is important for accurate use in any further spatial analysis or integration with other geographic data."
Features and Capabilities,"What other features do you have on the development horizon?","We are planning several exciting features to enhance both the back-end and front-end of our service. These include reverse geocoding, which enables converting geographic coordinates back into addresses. We're also working on integrating Quick Street and Rural Address Matching (QSTRM) technology to improve detection of rural and western Canadian addresses. Additionally, we aim to offer the ability to change datums and coordinate systems in output data for greater flexibility. Finally, users will soon be able to export results in popular geospatial formats such as shapefiles and GeoJSON (Geographic JavaScript Object Notation), making it easier to use the data in various Geographic Information System (GIS) applications."
Technical Details,"Which Geographic Information System (GIS) software and solutions are available to me after I get my geocoded points?","Depending on your technical needs and level of commitment, several options are available. Health Canada (HC) and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) are developing an Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stack, where you can request a username and password to access the Kibana Elastic Map interface for thematic mapping and overlaying your geocoded points. You can also install Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS), a free and open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software, on your local computer for detailed spatial analysis. For more advanced geospatial processing, the Digital Transformation Branch (DTB) Geomatics team offers specialized virtual machine (VM) environments equipped with Esri ArcGIS Pro 3.x software, which can scale on demand to support heavier spatial analysis workloads."
Costs and Licensing,"Is this service free-of-charge?","For now, yes—the service is free to use. We do ask that you be respectful of the size and frequency of your requests to ensure fair access for everyone. In the future, we plan to introduce some form of cost recovery, such as a token-based subscription model. However, rest assured it will remain much more cost-effective compared to services like Google or Esri."
General Information,"What can I do with geocoding results?","Many users have valuable spatial data trapped in Excel files, especially if those files include Canadian-formatted addresses. By converting these addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates, you unlock the ability to perform a wide range of spatial analyses. For example, you can conduct cluster analysis and anomaly detection to identify patterns or outliers. You can also generate summary statistics based on geographic boundaries such as Health Regions or Local Health Integration Networks (LHINs). Visualization tools like heat maps become possible, and you can carry out advanced analytics—such as optimizing travel routes for distributing personal protective equipment (PPE) or vaccines, or determining travel thresholds for public health planning."
General Information,"Do I have to use the API?","No, you don't have to use the API. The Digital Transformation Branch's (DTB) Geomatics Group offers a user-friendly, web-based application with an intuitive user experience (UX) and interface (UI). This tool lets you upload your Excel files, verify the content, view individual geocoding results, and export data—including latitude, longitude, source, and match type—for use in your analyses. It's an excellent option if you're not comfortable with programming or if you face technical barriers to using the API."
General Information,"Does this have a bilingual version?","A bilingual version is currently in development and will be available in the future."
General Information,"Is this application Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 ""AA"" compliant?","The application is designed with accessibility in mind and is theoretically compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 'AA' standards. Since our development team has full access to the source code, we are committed to ongoing improvements to further enhance accessibility over time."
